# lausanne_fsaverage
Annototation files made for lausanne fsaverage. I could not find these on the internet, so I made some instead. Made by fitting the lausanne gcs files to Mindboggle-101 participants. Individual annots were warped to fsaverage space and then majority voting used to determine lable at each vertex.
